The ocr folder contains an optical character recognition (OCR) system for hand-written characters, as a practice on binary image analysis.

The 'texture synthesis and image inpainting' folder contains implementation of:
1. Efros and Leungâ€™s approach for texture synthesis.
2. Image inpainting to fill in gaps in images.
3. Object removal as proposed by Criminisi, Perez and Toyama.
4. Image quilting for texture synthesis as proposed by Efros and Freeman.

The 'neural network classification' folder contains a convolutional neural network for classification of traffic sign images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.
